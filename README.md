# Undergraduate-Thesis-Code
This repository contains code that I used for my thesis in my final year of undergraduate. This code is used to interact with two specific hardware pieces - a Time-to-Digital Converter (TDC) from IDQ (ID801) and a tunable filter from WLPhotonics. This repository uses code provided by the suppliers and also a python wrapper for the TDC code.
